### React Animations

In this course section here, we will explore how we can animate React apps,
how we can bring them to life because whilst static apps that don't have any animations
of course also might work, animated apps often look and feel better,
and therefore may also drive user engagement with your website.

### we'll actually start by taking a look at just CSS

because you might not even know which features
are built into CSS that can be used to animate parts
of your website.

But as you'll also see in this section
CSS animations might be enough in certain use cases
but they also have certain limitations.

### Framer Motion

And that's why for the majority of this section
we'll explore a third party package called Framer Motion
which is an amazing package for building
and controlling more complex animations.
And you will learn how to use that package,
how to for example, use it to animate elements on the screen
in and out to animate lists.
And also how to build scroll based animations.
So animations that depend on the user scrolling
on the website as you can see it on the starting page
of that finished website, for example.
